This documents how I installed Linux Mint 17.3 on a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14", purchased from Best Buy.

Dual Boot with Windows
======================

[Follow the steps here](https://github.com/longsleep/yoga3pro-linux/blob/master/Yoga%203%20Linux%20HOWTO.md). He uses different hardware but they are similar enough:

1.  Create recovery USB flash drive
2.  Shrink Windows partition
3.  Disable FastStartup
    *   On Windows 10, this is under "Choose what the power buttons do."
4.  BIOS Settings
    *   I checked but nothing needed to be changed
5.  Boot from USB flash drive
    *   Instead of Ubuntu, install Linux Mint 17.3
6.  **Skip** his section on "wifi". You won't be able to fix it here.
7.  Install Linux Mint 17.3
8.  **Stop**. The remaining stuff on the above link don't apply to the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga. Keep reading below.

Find a way to get large (50MB) files from the Internet to Linux
===============================================================

Wifi doesn't work out of the box, but we're going to need to download a newer kernel

Easiest is an **external USB Wifi Adapter**. However supposedly few work on Linux Mint. I use Realtek 802.11n Adapter.

Otherwise wifi works in Windows so you can boot to Windows, download the files, then transfer to the Linux side. Options include:

- **a big USB flash drive**
- **[read directly from Windows mount](CUSTOMIZATIONS.md#mount-windows-drive-read-only)**

Fix Wifi for Intel Wireless 8260
================================

Confirm you have the `Intel Wireless 8260` card (`$ inxi -Fxz`) and that it's not currently working
(`$ sudo lshw -c network` will show: `*-network UNCLAIMED` for the relevant
card).

Support for this card comes from a set of [Intel drivers called `iwlwifi`](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi). This card was added in version 8000C-13, and this version requires Linux Kernel >= 4.1.

However, it's not so simple. Just because `iwlwifi` can support it in Linux >= 4.1, the kernel must _also_ be told to look for this driver when it sees your specific wifi card.

[This mapping wasn't added until December 2016](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/iwlwifi/iwlwifi-fixes.git/commit/?id=4ab75944c4b324c1f5f01dbd4c4d122d2b9da187) â€“ meaning it only got added to kernels that were being supported at that time: **4.1.17** and higher microversions, as well as **4.4**, are maintained. But 4.2 and 4.3 were EOL.

### Here's how to proceed:

1.  Wifi can work on 4.1.17, but later on we'll see graphics
    problems on 4.1, so go ahead and install __Kernel 4.4__ now. [Follow Laurent85's instructions for 4.4 here](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=216235#p1132177), including the newer `linux-firmware`.

2.  Also install the right version of [those intel drivers](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi):

        d /tmp/
        wget https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/_media/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi-8000-ucode-16.242414.0.tgz
        tar xzf iwlwifi-8000*.tgz
        sudo mv iwlwifi-8000*/iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode /lib/firmware/

3.  Reboot to the 4.4 kernel by selecting it in Grub.

# Fix graphics (standby and hardware graphics acceleration)

**Kernel 4.1** breaks hardware graphics acceleration by default and also breaks standby.

*   Acceleration can be fixed via grub boot options: include a flag `i915.preliminary_hw_support=1` that enables support for newer hardware, which had been included by default in 3.19 but removed in newer kernel versions.
*   Standby is hopeless in 4.1.

With **Kernel 4.4** both acceleration and standby both work great after installing the nvidia drivers (no grub flags needed):

    sudo apt-get install nvidia-352

If in the future, some package manager update happens to bork graphics (e.g.
[the November 2016 forced upgrade to
`nvidia-367=367.57`](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=233050
)): You can always add `nomodeset` to the `linux` command through GRUB to get
some half-working graphical desktop.

Things that still don't work...
===============================

Auto-rotate screen when I flip the computer
-------------------------------------------

Not working. There are two sides to this...

### Orientation detection

There are many almost-working scripts (e.g. [^1], [^2], [^3]) out there and they all rely on
`/sys/bus/iio`. Strangely this location doesn't exist on my computer.

* [I've also asked about this on the Linux Mint Forums.](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=221038)
* They
also all mention systemd as a requirement, which [Linux Mint 17.3 doesn't
support](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2921385/its-optional-for-now-but-linux-mint-expects-to-switch-to-systemd-next-year.html).

### Rotation (manual)

Really the oriendation detection is moot because I cannot even rotate the screen manually.

    $ xrandr --output eDP1 --rotate left
    xrandr: output eDP1 cannot use rotation "left" reflection "none"

Alternately:

    xrandr -o right

reduces screen size significantly and doesn't rotate anyway. (To get out of this, Win+Space, type "Display" and re-Apply the Desktop.)

Perhaps the versions of xrandr and of the NVIDIA driver (nvidia-352)
don't support this together? https://bugs.launchpad.net/nvidia-drivers-ubuntu/+bug/518132


Occasionally standby stops working
----------------------------------

Usually standby works (either through menu or by closing the lid).
But every 10th time or so it stops and standby won't work again til laptop
is rebooted.

Specifically:

* closing the lid does nothing.  When closing the lid the following is emitted to dmesg:

    i915 0000:00:02.0: BAR 6: [??? 0x00000000 flags 0x2] has bogus alignment

* clicking the "Quit" menu item ends up lagging about 1 minute til the Shutdown
  popup appears, and this popup is missing the (usually present) "Standby" option.
