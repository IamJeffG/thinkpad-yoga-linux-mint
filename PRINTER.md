Follow [the instructions here](http://tutorialforlinux.com/2015/12/12/how-to-install-canon-mx490-mx492-mx494-mx495-printer-drivers-on-ubuntu-15-10-wily-32-64bit-quickstart-scanning-easy-guide/).

* No problem that the available driver is really MX495. However do ensure you download Linux 64-bit.
* You do not need `libpng3` as it is superceded by `libpng12-0`.
